# ALX Listing App

The **ALX Listing App** is a foundational project designed to scaffold and set up the structure for building a modern Airbnb-style property listing application. This milestone focuses on creating a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase using industry-standard tools and best practices.

## 🏗️ Purpose of the Project

This milestone lays the groundwork for the entire application. By completing it, we establish:

- A properly configured **Next.js** environment (using the **Pages Router**).
- **TypeScript** for type safety.
- **TailwindCSS** for styling and responsive UI design.
- **Reusable components** to encourage clean and consistent UI patterns.
- A strong **folder structure** for scalability and clarity.
